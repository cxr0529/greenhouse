Julian Mussig immigrated to the United States from Germany in hopes of building a better life for himself.  After gaining much horticulture experience as a employee in a greenhouse.  Julian decided to strike out on his own and established Mussig Greenhouse. After successfully operating the business for nearly thirty years Julian then sold the business to his son, Sonny in 1965.</p>

In 1990 John Mussig, sitting on the Board of Directors for the Pennsylvania Flower Growers Region 4, took over the 31 greenhouse establishment and through hard work and dedication, has continued to see his Grandfather's dream grow.
